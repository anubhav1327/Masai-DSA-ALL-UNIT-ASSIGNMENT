// DpNation - Stock Broker 1
// Description

// on day i, price of element is pi

// If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one 
// share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

// Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

// Example 1:

// Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
// Output: 5
// Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
//              Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
// Example 2:

// Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
// Output: 0
// Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

// Input
// 1<=T<=10

// 2<=N<=100000

// 1<=Ai<=1000*1000*1000


// Output
// output a single integer, the profit attained


// Sample Input 1 

// 2
// 6
// 7 1 5 3 6 4
// 4
// 4 3 2 1
// Sample Output 1

// 5
// 0
