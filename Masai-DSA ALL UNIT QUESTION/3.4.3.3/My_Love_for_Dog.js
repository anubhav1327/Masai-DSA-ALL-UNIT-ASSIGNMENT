// My Love for Dogs Ended
// Description

// I have brought home n dogs. Now, being a dog lover, I am taking care of the dogs and brought dog food for them. Being a guy with no idea what to buy, I brought some n packets of dog food (I atleast knew that each and every dog being a good junkie will completely eat a whole packet of dog food and won't share anything with other dogs).

// Each food packet has some calorie value c. If a dog with original strength s eats that packet, the strength of the dog becomes c*s. I did not know this fact and now all the dogs won't be able to eat the maximum strength packet and increase their strength (and annoying powers).

// You are provided with the original strength of each dog and the calorie value of each of the n packets. Help me by telling me what is the maximum value of sum of the final strengths of the dogs that can be obtained if each dog is given a whole packet of dog food to eat.


// Input
// Input Format:

// The first line of the input will consist of n, the number of cats as well as the number of food packets brought by me.

// The second line will consist of n space separated integers si, the original strength of the dogs.

// Third line consists of n space separated integers ci, the calorie value of food packets.

// Constraints:

// 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000000

// 1 ≤ si ≤ 1000000

// 1 ≤ ci ≤ 1000000


// Output
// An integer which is the maximum value of sum of the final strengths of the dogs that can be obtained.


// Sample Input 1 

// 2
// 3 1
// 4 3
// Sample Output 1

// 15
