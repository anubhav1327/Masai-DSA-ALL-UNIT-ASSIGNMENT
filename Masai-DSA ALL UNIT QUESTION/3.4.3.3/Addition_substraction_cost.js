// Addition, Subtraction and its Cost Ended
// Description

// You have an array consisting of N integers .You are allowed to perform 2 kinds of operation on this array.

// Type 1 : Increment any integer of the array by 1.

// Type 2 : Decrement any integer of the array by 1.

// You can perform these operation as many times as you want on this array.

// Each operation of Type 1 costs 3 while each operation of Type 2 costs 5.

// You want to have K equal elements in this array. What is the minimum cost required in obtaining K equal elements in this array?


// Input
// Input Format:

// The first line contains T indicating test cases.

// Second line contains 2 integers N indicating the number of elements in the array and K.

// Third line contains N space separated integers denoting array.

// Constraints:

// 1 ≤ T ≤ 100

// 1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤100

// 1 ≤ A[i] ≤100


// Output
// The minimum cost required to get K equal elements.


// Sample Input 1 

// 1
// 5 3
// 9 4 9 7 4
// Sample Output 1

// 6
