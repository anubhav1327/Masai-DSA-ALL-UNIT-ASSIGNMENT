// Challenge 1A Ended
// Description

// Sam is the owner of gym and he gives advice to all his body-builders and he needs to prepare them such that the sum of their strengths is maximum.

// A builder having original strength s, after eating protein bar of calorie value c will have strength s*c

// Each protein bar can be eaten only once and by only one person.


// Input
// Input Format:

// The first line of the input will consist of n, the number of body-builders as well as the number of protein bars.

// The second line will consist of n space-separated integers s[i], the original strength of body-builders

// The third line consists of n space-separated integers c[i], the calorie value of protein bars.

// Constraints:

// 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6

// 1 ≤ si ≤ 10^6

// 1 ≤ ci ≤ 10^6


// Output
// Output:

// An integer which is the maximum value of sum of the final strengths of the body-builders that can be obtained.


// Sample Input 1 

// 2
// 3 1
// 4 3
// Sample Output 1

// 15
