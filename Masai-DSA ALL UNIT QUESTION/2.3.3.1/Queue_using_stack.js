// Implement Queue using Stack Ended
// Description

// Complete the function of push and pop and front for a queue, stack object names are S1 and S2.

// Expected Time complexity is O(N) for push and O(1) for pop and front.


// Input
// This is a function complete problem. You just have to complete the function. The input format given below is just for your understanding.

// The first line of the input contains Q, the number of queries to be executed.

// Each query X is of type X = 0, X = 1 or X = 2.

// Query X = 0 indicates, an element Y to be pushed into the queue.

// Query X = 2 indicates, an element to be removed from the queue.

// Query X = 1 indicates, an element to be peeked from the queue.


// Output
// For each query of type X = 1, print the value at the front of the queue.


// Sample Input 1 

// 6
// 0 1
// 0 2
// 0 3
// 1 
// 2
