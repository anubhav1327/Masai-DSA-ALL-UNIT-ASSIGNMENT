// Number of ways to reach the end Ended
// Description

// Ayush is running a marathon. There a number of start points in this marathon. At each start point x, you have an energy drink which gives you y amount of energy. With 1 unit of energy, you can travel 1 km distance. Therefore, if you start at x and have an energy drink of y, you will be able to travel for y kms from x. Your task is to find out the number of points from the given list of points, starting from which with 0 energy, ayush will be able to reach the end. The end is always located at 100000.


// Input
// Input Format

// First line contains T, the number of test cases

// First line of each test case has a single integer n, the number of points

// The second line of each test case contains n space separated integers which represent the starting points

// The third line of each test case contains n space separated integers which represent respective energy drink values for each starting point

// Input Constraints

// 1 <= t <= 10

// 1 <= n <= 1e5

// 1 <= x <= 1e5,1 <= y <= 1e3


// Output
// For each test case, print on a new line, the number of points from the given list of points starting from which ayush will be able to complete the race.
