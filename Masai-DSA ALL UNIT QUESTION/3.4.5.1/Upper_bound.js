// Upper Bound in LogN
// Description

// You are given n different numbers and an integer k. Write a program that finds upper bound of k in log(n) time complexity. Upper bound of a number k in a sorted list is the index of the first number which is greater than k (here the answer is given considering index to be starting from 0)

// -> Test cases are such that there is always one number greater than k

// NOTE: YOU MUST NOT USE BRUTE FORCE SOLUTION

// WE KNOW THAT YOU KNOW BRUTE FORCE SOLUTION AND WANT YOU TRY THE LOGN SOLUTION

// USING BRUTE FORCE/LINEAR SEARCH, IN THIS CASE, WOULD LEAD TO DISQUALIFICATION


// Input
// Input Format

// First line contains N and K

// Second line contains N space separated sorted integers

// Constraints

// N<100


// Output
// Output upper bound


// Sample Input 1 

// 10 3
// 0 2 4 4 5 5 7 7 9 10
// Sample Output 1

// 2
// Sample Input 2 

// 10 4
// 0 2 4 4 5 5 7 7 9 10
// Sample Output 2

// 4
