// Lower bound in logn 

// You are given n different numbers and an integer k. Write a program that finds lower bound of k in log(n) time complexity. Lower bound of a number k in a sorted list is the index of the first number which is same as k, in case the number is not present, print -1 (here the answer is given considering index to be starting from 0)

// NOTE: YOU MUST NOT USE BRUTE FORCE SOLUTION.

// WE KNOW THAT YOU KNOW BRUTE FORCE SOLUTION AND WANT YOU TO TRY THE LOGN SOLUTION.

// USING BRUTE FORCE/LINEAR SEARCH, IN THIS CASE, WOULD LEAD TO DISQUALIFICATION.


// Input
// Input Format

// First line contains N and K

// Second line contains N space separated sorted integers

// Constraints

// N<100


// Output
// Output lower bound


// Sample Input 1 

// 5 2
// 1 1 2 2 5
// Sample Output 1

// 2
// Sample Input 2 

// 5 3
// 1 1 2 2 5
// Sample Output 2

// -1
