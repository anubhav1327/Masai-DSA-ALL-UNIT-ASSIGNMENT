// Two Sum One Numbers II Ended
// Description

// You are given five numbers, stored in the variables with the following names

// one, two, three, four, five

// Find the value ofsum1andsum2, such that

// sum1 = one + two 

// sum2 = three + four

// If the value of sum1 or sum2 is greater than the value stored in variablefive, printYes, else printNo


// Input
// The first and the only line of the input contains the value stored in variablesone, two, three, four, fiverespectively


// Output
// PrintYes, if either the value ofsum1orsum2is greater than the value stored infive, else printNo


// Sample Input 1 

// 1 2 3 4 5 
// Sample Output 1

// Yes
// Hint

// In the sample test case, the value stored inone = 1, two = 2, three = 3, four = 4, five = 5

// Therefore, the value of

// sum1 = one + two = 1 + 2 = 3

// sum2 = three + four = 3 + 4 = 7

// Now, the value of sum1 is lesser than the value stored in five, but the value stored in sum2 is greater than five. Therefore, the answer isYes
