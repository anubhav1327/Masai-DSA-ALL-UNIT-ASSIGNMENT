// Kazama & Shinchan 
// Description

// Shinchan & Kazama are classmates at Futaba Kindergarten. I- chan likes shinchan, more than Kazama. Kazama wants to prove to I-chan that he is smarter than Shinchan, so he tries to boast his knowledge about numbers in front of her. He takes an sorted array of N integers, and asks I-chan for a number K. If the number exists in the array, he will return the index where the number is present, else he returns the index where it would be if it were inserted in order. This task seems to be very difficult for Kazama, so he asks you for help. Help him, or else he will lose his friendship with I-chan.


// Input
// The first line contains N, the size of the array. Next line contains N space separated integers, indicating the values in the array.

// Next line contains K, the value I-chan gave to search.



// Constraints:

// 1 <= N <= 10^4
// -10^4<= array[i] <= 10^4
// numscontainsdistinctvalues sorted inascendingorder.
// -10^4<= K <= 10^4

// Output
// Print a single integer denoting the position of K in the array, if present, else indicating the position where it would be if inserted in sorted order.
