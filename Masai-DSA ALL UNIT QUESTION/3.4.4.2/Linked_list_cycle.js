// Linked List Cycle 
// Description

// Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

// There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached 
// again by continuously following thenextpointer. Internally,posis used to denote the 
// index of the node that the tail'snextpointer is connected to.

// Note-posis not passed as a parameter.

// Complete the function below. No need to take any input, just return if the given linked list has a cycle in it or not.Returntrueif there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, returnfalse.

// Note- All the nodes are different


// Input
// This is a function complete problem.

// Refer to sample input for understanding

// The first line contains the number of cases (t)

// Next line contains number of nodes in the first linked list (n)

// Next n lines contains the linked list

// Next line contains the position of the node that the tail of the linked list points to. (If it's -1 then it doesn't point to anything)

// t <= 10

// n <= 10


// Output
// Complete the function


// Sample Input 1 

// 1
// 3
// 1
// 2
// 3
// -1
// Sample Output 1

// false
