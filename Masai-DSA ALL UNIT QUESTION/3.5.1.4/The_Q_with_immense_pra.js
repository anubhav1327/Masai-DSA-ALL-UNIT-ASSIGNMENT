// The question with immense practical application 
// Description

// The solution to this question is a very popular algorithm used for:

// Spell correction and suggestion by search engines
// Computational Biology
// Machine Translation
// Information Extraction
// Speech Recognition
// NLP
// Needleman‚ÄêWunsch Algorithm, etc. to name a few
// "Edit distance" (also known as Levenshtein distance) measures the minimum number of simple
//  changes to move from one string to another. Possible changes include the insertion of a 
// single character, the deletion of a single character, or the substitution from one character
//  to another. Your program must calculate the edit distance between pairs of strings.

// Input
// Input Format

// First line contains the number of test cases.

// Each test case is presented on subsequent pairs of lines with a string on each line. Strings
//  will consist of non-whitespace printable characters.

// Constraints
// Length of both strings <= 2000

// Output
// The edit distance of each test case should be output, one value per line.

// Sample Input 1 

// 3
// abcde
// abde
// abde
// abcde
// abcde
// abxde
// Sample Output 1

// 1
// 1
// 1
