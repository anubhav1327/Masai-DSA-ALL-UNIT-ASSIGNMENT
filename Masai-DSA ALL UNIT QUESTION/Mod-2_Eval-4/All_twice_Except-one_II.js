// All Twice Except One II Ended
// Description

// You are given a numberN, and an array such that the array contains all the numbers from 1 to N including N twice, except for one, which is present only once

// You have to find the number which is present only once, in the array


// Input
// The first line of the input containsT, the number of test cases

// The first line of each test case, containsN, the value as explained in the problem statement

// The next line contains2*N - 1, the number of elements in the array

// Constraints

// 1 <= T <= 10

// 1 <= N <= 2 * 10^5

// 1 <= arr[i] <= N

// Output
// For each test case, print the number which is present only once, on a new line

// Sample Input 1 

// 1
// 5
// 1 2 1 3 4 4 5 2 3
// Sample Output 1

// 5
// Hint
