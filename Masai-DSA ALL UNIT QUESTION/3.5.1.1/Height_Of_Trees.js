// Height of trees Ended
// Description

// You are given n trees and their heights. Your task is to write a program that calculates the maximum number of trees whose height is in strictly increasing order. They need not be in continuous manner.

// For instance, if heights of 9 trees are 10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80. The maximum number of trees whose height is in increasing order is 6 : (10, 22, 33, 50, 60, 80).

// (9,21, 41, 60, 80) is also in increasing manner but you need to find the maximum number of trees whose height is increasing. So, the answer is 6


// Input
// Input Format

// First line contains n

// Next line contains n space separated integers which representing heights of n trees.

// Constraints

// n <= 1000


// Output
// Output Format

// Output the max number of trees whose height is in increasing order


// Sample Input 1 

// 9
// 10 22 9 33 21 50 41 60 80
// Sample Output 1

// 6
