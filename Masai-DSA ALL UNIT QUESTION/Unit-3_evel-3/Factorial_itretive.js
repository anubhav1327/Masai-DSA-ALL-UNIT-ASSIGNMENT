// Factorial-Iterative Ended
// Description

// The factorial of a positive integer N is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n:

// Given a number N your task is to write a program that calculates factorial of N

// Note: You must not recursion. Use iteration to solve the problem

// *Extra*: The Church-Turing thesis states that what is computable by recursive functions is computable by an iterative model (such as the Turing machine) and vice versa

// So, in this case we want you to write iterative approach to it


// Input
// Input Format

// First and the only line contains N

// Constraints

// N<15


// Output
// Output Format

// Output the factorial value of N


// Sample Input 1 

// 5
// Sample Output 1

// 120
// Hint

// Sample 1 Explanation

// Factorial of 5 = 5*4*3*2*1 = 120
