// Noddy's Examination Ended
// Description

// Noddy has an exam in which each question has a difficulty level in the form of an Integer. Now, Noddy can only solve the problems that have difficulty level less than or equal to X. Now the rules are-

// The score of the student is equal to the maximum number of answers he/she has attempted without skipping a question.

// The student is allowed to skip just "one" question that will not be counted in the continuity of the questions.

// Note- Assume the student knows the solution to the problem he/she attempts and always starts the paper from the first question.

// Given the number of Questions, N, the maximum difficulty level of the problem Noddy can solve, X, and the difficulty level of each question in the form of an array

// Determine the maximum score that Noddy can score?


// Input
// First Line contains Integer N, the number of questions and the maximum difficulty X Noddy can solve.

// Next line contains N integers, denoting the difficulty level of each question.

// N <= 100000

// X <= 1000000000

// Difficulty level of each question <= 1000000000


// Output
// Print the maximum score that Noddy can score


// Sample Input 1 

// 7 6
// 4 3 7 6 7 2 2
// Sample Output 1

// 3
// Hint

// Sample 1 Explanation

// In this example, maximum difficulty = 6, Noddy solves question 0 and 1, but skips the question 2 as A[2]>6. Monk then solves the question 3 , but stops at 4 because A[4]>6 and question 2 was already skipped. As 3 questions (0,1 and 3) were solved and 2 questions (2 and 4) have been skipped, therefore we print "3".
