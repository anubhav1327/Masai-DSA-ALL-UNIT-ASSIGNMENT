// Long Queue
// Description
// There is a long queue of people in front of ATMs. Due to withdrawal limit per person 
// per day, people come in groups to withdraw money.

// Groups come one by one and line up behind the already present queue. The groups have 
// a strange way of arranging themselves.

// In a particular group, the group members arrange themselves in increasing order of 
// their height(not necessarily strictly increasing).

// You are given a array representing heights of persons in queue. Since groups are 
// standing behind each other, one cannot differentiate between different groups and the 
// exact count cannot be given.

// Can you find the minimum number of groups that can be observed in the queue?


// Input
// Input Format:

// The first line of input contains one positive integer N.

// The second line contains N space-separated integers, H[i] denoting the height of 
// i-th person. Each group has group members standing in increasing order of their height.

// Constraints:

// 1 <= N <= 1000000
// 1 <= H[i] <= 1000000

// Output
// Print the minimum number of groups that are at least present in the queue.

// Sample Input 1 
// 6
// 1 2 4 3 5 8
// Sample Output 1

// 2
// Hint

// Minimum groups for queue [1,2,4,3,5,8] is 2as  [1, 2, 4] can be in 1 
// group and [3, 5, 8] can be  in other.
